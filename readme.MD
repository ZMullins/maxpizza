# BestPizzaFor.Me
Website to choose the best pizza deal using the power of math. 

Written using jQuery and Bootstrap 4.

This began as a mini-project to learn jQuery and Bootstrap, however I have decided to work on some cool features for it. It currently is very buggy and early state, but the basic calculation should work.



## Upcoming Fixes/Features

- The javascript code is a mess. This was done as a learning project, but I plan to go back and clean that up.

- The delete system is buggy, once I rebase the JS this should be easy to fix

- A backend, so I can start to implement some real fun features:
  
	- "How many do I need to feed" features, where the user can get recommendations for serving size of their party.
  
	- Open up submissions for users to input local deals in their area. You can then compare the price of your pizza compared to 	  local averages
  
	- Implement sides as a part of deal. Assign some method of assigning "value" to sides, soda, that come with pizza
